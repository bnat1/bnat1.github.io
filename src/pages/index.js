                                My name is Nat Baylon. I am a full stack software engineer with five years of experience working in agile teams. 
                                I have lived and worked in Maryland for most of my life, but I am currently based in Granada, a beautiful city in the south of Spain, where my wife is from.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I started getting interested in web development and coding in middle school, when I had the opportunity to do some programming in an informatics class, and since then, I was hooked. 
                                During my university years, I attended several hackathons with my friends, and we even placed 2<sup>nd</sup> in HackUMBC 2016! 
                                A year later, I graduated with honors in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2017. 
                                For the past few years, I have been traveling the world while working remotely as a Full Stack Software Engineer with <a href="https://www.healytics.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healytics</a>, 
                                a Baltimore-based health information management and genome processing company, 
                                where I continue to sharpen my skills while doing what I enjoy the most.

                                Here's a walkthrough of the technologies I most commonly use when developing applications:

                            </header>
                            <p>
                                I have lately been developing single page applications (SPAs) using React. 
                                I like using Bootstrap or Semantic UI for styling / componentry, and Axios.js as a RESTful HTTP client. 
                                To manage the state of componentry, I started out using Redux, 
                                but later switched to using the built-in Context API to reduce boiler-plate code and to improve maintainability.
                            </p>
                            <header>
                                <h3>Front-end Server & API Gateway</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>
                                I am of the mindset that the front-end should be decoupled from the back-end to allow the two to be developed, built, and deployed separately. 
                                I currently use Nginx to achieve this since it can serve front-end builds and reverse-proxy HTTP requests to RESTful back-ends. Compared with Apache,
                                Nginx makes a much better use of threads, is event driven, asynchronous, and non-blocking, making it able to handle a larger throughput.
                            </p>
                            <header>
                                <h3>Back-end</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>
                                On the server side, I like to handle requests using Node Express. 
                                When the back-end needs to be scaled up, I use PM2 to allow the application to run on multiple processes. 
                                In cloud environments, I have used AWS Elastic Beanstalk to horizontally scale the application as well.
                                Due to its single threaded asynchronous nature, Node.js is particularly good at handling the most common types of requests,
                                such as running queries on a database or making additional RESTful calls. 
                                But if more computationally heavy tasks need to be handled (processing large files or math for example),
                                I asynchronously spawn a Java or C++ process, allowing Node's thread to handle other requests while the spawned process does the heavy lifting.
                                I am beginning to learn Go because of its ability to handle the heavier tasks well, 
                                but I suspect that in the end, I will stick to Node to handle the most common back-end use cases because it performs roughly as well as go for these cases.

                            <p>
                                When working with relational data, I typically choose Postgres as the database because it offers many features and can handle complicated queries and large datasets well. 
                                I use a good ORM in applications to query the database, such as Sequelize, to make the code more manageable and readable.
                                When working with non-relational data or when rapidly prototyping an application, MongoDB is my go-to because it is very developer friendly.

                                In my local development environment, I use Ubuntu or a similar Linux distribution, VS Code as my text editor, and git and Github / Bitbucket for source control. 
                                And when working with teams, I have used Jira and Confluence to manage tasking and documentation respectively.

                                Github and Bitbucket both have plugins available for triggering build servers on the event merging of pull requests, which
                                I like to configure so that merging into the master branch triggers Jenkins to build the project. 
                                I use webpack for minifying JavaScript projects, and Maven for building Java projects, 
                                and I use Docker to containerize the parts of the project.
