                                My name is Nat Baylon. I am a full stack developer with five years of experience working in agile teams. 
                                I have lived and worked in Maryland for most of my life, but I am currently living in Granada, a beautiful city in the south of Spain, where my wife is from.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I started getting interested in web development and coding in middle school, when I had the opportunity to do some programming in an informatics class, and since then, I was hooked. 
                                During my university years, I attended several hackathons with my friends, and we even placed 2<sup>nd</sup> in HackUMBC 2016! 
                                A year later, I graduated with Honors in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2017. 
                                For the past two years, I have been working remotely with <a href="https://www.healytics.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healytics</a>, a Baltimore-based health information management company, 
                                where I continue to sharpen my skills while doing what I enjoy the most.

                                Here's a walkthrough of the technologies I most commonly use when developing applications:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the front-end, I have lately been developing single page applications (SPAs) with React. 
                                I like using Bootstrap or Semantic UI for styling / componentry, and Axios.js as a RESTful HTTP client. 
                                To manage the state of componentry, I started out using Redux, 
                                but later switched to using the built-in Context API to reduce boiler-plate code and to improve maintainability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am of the mindset that the front-end should be decoupled from the back-end to allow the two to be developed, built, and deployed separately. 
                                I currently use Nginx to achieve this since it can serve front-end builds and reverse-proxy HTTP requests to RESTful back-ends. Compared with Apache,
                                Nginx makes a much better use of threads, is event driven, asynchronous, and non-blocking, making it able to handle a larger throughput.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the server side, I like to use Node + Express because of its speedy request handling and npm's wide variety of available libraries. 
                                When the back-end needs to be scaled up to multiple processes, I use PM2.
                                While Javascript isn't particularly good at computationally heavy tasks (reading and processing large files or math for example),
                                it handles other use cases very well, such as handling requests that require database querying. And when heavy lifting is needed,
                                I offload this work to Java or C++, allowing both fast request handling and fast data processing. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When working with relational data, I typically choose Postgres because it offers many features and can execute complicated queries and large datasets well. 
                                I use a good ORM in applications to query the database, such as Sequelize, to make the code more manageable and readable.
                                When working with non-relational data or when rapidly prototyping an application, MongoDB is my go-to because it is very developer friendly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my local development environment, I use Ubuntu or a similar Linux distribution, VS Code as my text editor, and git + Github / Bitbucket for source control. 
                                When working with teams, I have used Jira and Confluence to manage tasking and documentation respectively.
